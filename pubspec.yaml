# # # # # # The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# # # # # # A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# # # # # # followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# # # # # # Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# # # # # # build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# # # # # # In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# # # # # # Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# # # # # # In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# # # # # # Read more about iOS versioning at
# # # # # # https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# # # # # # In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# # # # # # of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

# # # # # # Dependencies specify other packages that your package needs in order to work.
# # # # # # To automatically upgrade your package dependencies to the latest versions
# # # # # # consider running `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`. Alternatively,
# # # # # # dependencies can be manually updated by changing the version numbers below to
# # # # # # the latest version available on pub.dev. To see which dependencies have newer

# # # # #   # The "flutter_lints" package below contains a set of recommended lints to
# # # # #   # encourage good coding practices. The lint set provided by the package is
# # # # #   # activated in the `analysis_options.yaml` file located at the root of your
# # # # #   # package. See that file for information about deactivating specific lint
# # # # #   # rules and activating additional ones.

# # # # #   # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
# # # # #   # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
# # # # #   # the material Icons class.

# # # # #   # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
# # # # #   # assets:
# # # # #   #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
# # # # #   #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

# # # # #   # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
# # # # #   # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

# # # # #   # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
# # # # #   # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

# # # # #   # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
# # # # #   # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
# # # # #   # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
# # # # #   # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
# # # # #   # example:
# # # # #   # fonts:
# # # # #   #   - family: Schyler
# # # # #   #     fonts:
# # # # #   #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
# # # # #   #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
# # # # #   #         style: italic
# # # # #   #   - family: Trajan Pro
# # # # #   #     fonts:
# # # # #   #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
